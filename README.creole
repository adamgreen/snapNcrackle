This project is no longer under active development.

== Overview
snap is a minimal 6502 assembler and crackle is a simple disk imaging utility.  The main goal of this project is to
create an assembler that is able to assemble the 
[[https://github.com/jmechner/Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II|Prince of Persia for Apple II sources]] and create/update a
disk image suitable for Apple II emulation.  As such it will only support the subset of directives that are required by
these sources.  I don't know how useful it will be in general for other 6502 assembly language projects.
