== Overview
snap is a simple cross-assembler for the 6502 processor.  The main goal of this project is to create enough of an
assembler to be able to assemble the 
[[https://github.com/jmechner/Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II|Prince of Persia for Apple II sources]] and create/update a
disk image suitable for emulation.  As such it will only support the subset of directives that are required by these
sources.  I don't know how useful it will be in general for other 6502 assembly language projects.
